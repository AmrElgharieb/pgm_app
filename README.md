# pgm_app
This repository shall contain the implementation of a simple program which calculates the average pgm for multiple pgm files

## How to run the script?

The script can be run using the following command  
python pgm_app.py C:\pgm_app\Python_Soluiton\InputFiles  (i.e. path to the input pgm files)  

The output file shall be generated inside the input directory


## Possible improvements to the scrript:

- Asserting that all pixels in each pgm does not exceed the specified max gray value  
- Assert that all files have the same magic number
